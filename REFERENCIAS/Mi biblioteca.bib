In digital imaging, JPEG is the most popular lossy compression standard and JPEG images are ubiquitous. Today’s digital techniques make it easy to tamper JPEG images without leaving any visible clues. Furthermore, most image tampering involves JPEG double compression, it heightens the need for accurate analysis of JPEG double compression in image forensics.},

This question has to be answered in child pornography cases, where evidence is needed that a certain picture has been made with a specific camera. We have looked into different methods of examining the cameras to determine if a specific image has been made with a camera: defects in CCDs, file formats that are used, noise introduced by the pixel arrays and watermarking in images used by the camera manufacturer.},
